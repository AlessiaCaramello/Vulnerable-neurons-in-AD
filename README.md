### Purpose of repository

This repository contains all R scripts used for performing data analysis for our project on neuronal vulnerability in Alzheimer's Disease (AD). A preprint of our study is available:

### Overview of the study

We used imaging mass cytometry (IMC) to identify the first neurons to be selectively lost in the human middle temporal gyrus in AD. IMC images were processed using the software [SIMPLI](https://github.com/ciccalab/SIMPLI) 
(the version used is available in my GitHub page). Raw and processed images, as well as SIMPLI output files are available on my
[figshare](https://figshare.com/account/home#/projects/228897/edit) repository (still private while paper is under review). 


### How to set up

1. **Prepare the "R code" folder**:
   This should should include:
   - "input" -> all necessary input files: SIMPLI output files (area_measurements.csv, clustered_cells.csv, all_cells-clusters.csv - not provided) and metadata (clusters_labels.csv, sample_rotation.csv, vars_per_sample.csv, markers_threshold.csv - provided)
   - "R scripts" -> all scripts available in this repository
   - "ImageJ_macro" -> containing the "ImageJ macro/Plaques mask and rings.ijm" script and the "mask_channels" folder (which should contain all amyloid-b ROIs - not provided)
   - "plots" -> [empty] output for plots
   - "tables" -> [empty] output for tables


2. **Adapt metadata**: 
   - clusters_labels.csv --> labels to assign to each cluster
   - sample_rotation.csv --> degree of clockwise rotation for turning each ROI in the correct orientation
   - vars_per_sample.csv --> additional variables that can be used to group samples for comparisons (sex, age, etc..)
   - markers_threshold.csv --> threshold at which a cells should be considered positive for a given marker


2. **Run ImageJ macro**:
   This will generate masks of plaques and surrounding area (rings) masks from the amyloid-b channel (rings "thinckness" as ums of enlargment around plaques can be defined in the macro)
